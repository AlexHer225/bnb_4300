Hangry is a meal tracking program that allows users to create, edit, and save meal plans. It contains both an non-authenticated and an authenticated view. Non authenticated users have access to a single week plan or have the option to create a profile to store more plans. The program utilizes Spoonacular api to fetch meal data from and MongoDB for handling HTTP requests.
